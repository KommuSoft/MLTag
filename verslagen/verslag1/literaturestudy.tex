\section{Literature study}
After a first exploration of some literature, we concluded there are two main strategies to solve this sort of problem. The first is using is transforming the multi-label classification problem into one or multiple single-label classification problems. Another way is to adapt a single-label algorithm to support the multi-label problem. Both approaches use single-label classification problems as a basis, so we had to study these as well. \cite{Tsoumakas07multi-labelclassification:} gives a general overview of the problem and suggests five transforming methods and ??. These algorithms use distance functions that we need to define based on characteristics of the samples, the todo sentence in our case. \cite{gjorgjioskicomparison} compares some distance measures in the context of multi-label classification problem. Another problem that arises with the previous is what will be the characteristics of the samples. \cite{jing2006ontology} specifically studies text how to couple text samples with distance measures, and so the characteristics.

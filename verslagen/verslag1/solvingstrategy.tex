\section{Solving strategy}
We will write an implementation in the .NET framework. We will start off with straightforward implementations of the papers we have read, such as the text measure of the \cite{jing2006ontology}. And we will start with CRPC\footnote{Calibrated Ranked Pairwise Comparison.}. CRPC is based on ranked pairwise learning which considers the possible labels pairwise to compare which one is more relevant. This first approach is called RPC\footnote{Ranked Pairwise Comparison.}, CRPC extends this concept with the reference point to have an absolute measure which tags are relevant, so multiple tags can be chosen as written in \cite{journals/ml/FurnkranzHMB08}. We also found \emph{Mulan}\footnote{\texttt{http://mulan.sourceforge.net/}}, a Java-library for multi-label classification, and we plan to compare our results with the performance of \emph{Mulan}. Hereafter we can see where in the algorithm most improvement is needed.
